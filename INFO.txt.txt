I'm using mindware EEG headset and it is providing me with data i.e. voltage fluctuations due to ionic current within the neurons of the brain.
It generally measures the voltage fluctuations within the neurons so the main focus is always the cortex of the brain(the larger number of neurons present)
It is actually electroencephalography i.e. EEG.
